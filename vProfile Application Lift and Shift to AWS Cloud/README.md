# vProfile Application Lift and Shift to AWS Cloud

This document provides a guide for setting up the vProfile application workload in the AWS cloud using a "Lift and Shift" migration strategy. The goal is to achieve a flexible, scalable infrastructure on AWS while minimizing upfront costs and embracing automation.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to migrate the vProfile application to AWS, enabling it to run in a production environment. This "Lift and Shift" approach involves transferring existing workloads to the cloud with minimal modification.

---

## Project Goals

- Host and run the vProfile application on AWS for production use.
- Gain hands-on experience in migrating workloads to AWS using a "Lift and Shift" method.

---

## Current Scenario

The application services are currently hosted on physical or virtual machines in an on-premises data center, with components including:

- Databases: PostgreSQL, Oracle
- Application services: Tomcat, LAMP stack
- DNS services

This setup requires coordination among multiple teams, including those responsible for virtualization, operations, monitoring, and system administration.

### Challenges

- Complex server and team management
- Limited scalability
- High operational costs
- Manual processes prone to error

---

## Solution Approach: AWS Cloud Migration

Moving to AWS offers:

- **Pay-as-you-go** cost structure, eliminating upfront expenses.
- **Flexibility and scalability** for resource management.
- **Automation** to reduce manual errors and improve efficiency.

---

## AWS Services Used

1. **Compute**: EC2 instances for application and database servers (Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcache, MySQL).
2. **Load Balancing**: Elastic Load Balancer to manage incoming requests and ensure availability.
3. **Auto Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts resources based on traffic.
4. **Storage**: S3 for object storage or EFS for shared file storage.
5. **DNS**: Route 53 for private DNS services.
6. **Additional Services**: IAM, ACM, EBS for security, SSL management, and storage.

---

## Project Objectives

- Establish a flexible, cloud-based infrastructure.
- Implement a pay-as-you-go model to avoid large capital expenditures.
- Modernize the application using AWS services.
- Leverage automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

---

## Architecture Design

1. **Compute**: Application services are hosted on EC2 instances.
2. **Load Balancer**: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) manages traffic distribution.
3. **Auto Scaling**: Resources scale automatically based on traffic load.
4. **Storage**: Data is stored using S3 or EFS, depending on requirements.
5. **DNS**: Route 53 handles DNS configurations for internal services.

---

## System Architecture Overview

1. **User Access**: Users access the application via a URL registered with GoDaddy, which directs traffic to the Application Load Balancer.
2. **Traffic Routing**: The load balancer manages HTTPS traffic and directs it to the Tomcat application instances in an Auto Scaling group.
3. **Backend Services**: Backend components like MySQL, Memcache, and RabbitMQ are accessed through Route 53 for internal communication.
4. **Security Groups**: All AWS components operate within defined security groups to ensure secure communication.

---

## Execution Guide

Follow these steps to implement the architecture on AWS:

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Log in** to your AWS account.
- **Create key pairs** for secure access to EC2 instances.

### Step 2: Security Groups
- Define security groups for:
  - **Load Balancer**
  - **Tomcat Application**
  - **Backend Services**

### Step 3: Launch EC2 Instances
- **Launch EC2 instances** for Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcache, and MySQL servers.
- Use **user data scripts** to configure instances on launch.

### Step 4: Configure Route 53 DNS
- Update the IP-to-name mapping for EC2 instances in **Route 53** to enable private DNS for backend services.

### Step 5: Application Deployment
- **Build the application** from source code locally.
- **Upload artifacts** (e.g., binaries, configuration files) to an S3 bucket for easy access during deployment.

### Step 6: Load Balancer Setup
- Set up the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with HTTPS connections for secure access.
- **Verify** the mapping of the ALB with GoDaddy DNS to ensure accessibility.

### Step 7: Auto Scaling Configuration
- After verifying the setup, **create an Auto Scaling group** for Tomcat instances to manage resources based on demand.

## Next Steps

With the basic architecture set up, you are now ready to dive into the AWS implementation details, refine configurations, and apply the best practices for high availability and fault tolerance.
