## Projects List

### 1. vProfile Application Lift and Shift to AWS Cloud

**Description**:  
This project focuses on migrating the vProfile application to the AWS cloud using the "Lift and Shift" strategy. The migration is designed to move the application from an on-premises data center to AWS with minimal changes. The goal is to provide a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-based solution using AWS services like EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, Route 53, and S3.

For more details, please see the [project guide]([vProfile Application Lift and Shift to AWS Cloud/README.md](https://github.com/Haroon-K/AWS-Projects/blob/main/vProfile%20Application%20Lift%20and%20Shift%20to%20AWS%20Cloud/README.md)).
